<h1><strong>Guess The Anime!</strong></h1></br>
<h3>The background of the game</h3>
Using JavaScript i've created an array of phrases and wrote functions to choose a random phrase from the the created array.<br/>
Split the phrase into letters and put those letters onto the game board. <br/>
 <br/>
Each time the player guesses a letter, you’ll need to compare the letter the player has chosen with the random phrase. <br/>
<br/> If the letter is in the phrase, you’ll update the game board with the chosen letters.<br/>

A player can keep choosing letters until they make five incorrect guesses. 
<br/>If the letter they chose isn’t in the phrase, you’ll remove one of the player’s 5 guesses.<br/>

If the player completes the phrase before they run out of guesses, a winning screen will display. 
<br/>If the player guesses incorrectly 5 times, a losing screen will display.<br/>

A player can guess a letter only once.
<br/>After they’ve guessed a letter, your programming will need to disable that letter.
